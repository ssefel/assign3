# Project Description
Pulling twitter data, design a web interface and represent the data visually. I used recent tweets with the hastag #todaysnews and created a hands free interface where the user can just sit back, relax and read recent news tweets without having to lift a finger in the process. It is set up that every 1 minute there is a new pull request from Twitters API, so you get the most recent tweets no matter how long you decide to sit infront of the screen and are able to read the new tweets coming in.

### Instructions
As mentioned no instructions needed, just relax with some coffee in your hand and read through the news that scrolls over your screen. If for some reason there is a glitch, just refresh the page and you are good to go :)
